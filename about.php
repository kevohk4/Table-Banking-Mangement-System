        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Table Banking provides members with the opportunity of taking credit in the 
            form loans without having any collateral while in conventional banking for somebody 
            to have access credit in the form to loans they will need to have collateral 
            for example land title deeds or car log books. Table Banking is achieved when a group 
            of people decide to create a kitty and make contributions during their planned
            meetings after some specified period of time. There are rules which guide 
            on how the Table Banking system operates as specified by members. These rules 
            guide on loan requests, loan repayment and cash deposits to the kitty by the members. 
            The objective of Table Banking is to help the poor, particularly women, 
            fight poverty and stay financially sound.</p>
